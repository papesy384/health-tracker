# Weight Tracking Workflow Automation - 3-Minute Pitch

## **THE WORKFLOW & WHY** (60 seconds)

### **The Problem We Solve**
- **Manual health tracking is broken**: People start tracking their weight, BMI, sleep, and exercise but abandon it within weeks
- **Data silos everywhere**: Health data scattered across apps, notes, and memory
- **No actionable insights**: Raw numbers don't translate to meaningful health decisions
- **Lack of automation**: Users must remember to track, calculate, and act on their health data

### **Our Solution: Automated Health Workflow**
- **One-click data entry**: Users input 4 key metrics (weight, height, sleep, exercise) once
- **Automatic processing**: System calculates BMI, generates personalized meal plans, and creates realistic timelines
- **Direct delivery**: Health reports sent automatically to user's email inbox
- **No manual intervention**: Everything happens behind the scenes after initial setup

### **Why This Matters**
- **Healthcare costs are rising**: Preventative health management reduces medical expenses
- **Time is precious**: Busy professionals need automated solutions, not another app to manage
- **Consistency drives results**: Automated workflows ensure users stay engaged with their health goals
